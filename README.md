# Immune Desync Patch

Immune Desync Patch is an exploratory systems project focused on detecting
coordination-level instability in physiological recovery dynamics under
explicitly bounded assumptions.

This repository is a governance-first systems artifact.
It is not a product, diagnostic system, predictive model, or clinical tool.

## Project Status

### v1 — Archived (Closed)
- Assumed static physiological baselines
- Failed by assumption, not execution
- Terminated to prevent misinterpretation or retrofitting
- Preserved solely for auditability

### v2 — Experimental (Active, Terminable)
- New system class
- Assumes directional (non-stationary) physiology
- Detects failure of recovery dynamics only
- Makes no diagnostic, predictive, or intervention claims
- Continuation is conditional and reversible

## Hackathon Relevance

Functions as:
- a live test of assumption discipline under time pressure
- a framework for deciding what not to build
- a bounded exploratory artifact that can be invalidated quickly

Termination is a valid outcome.
